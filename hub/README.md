# yoyoengine hub

The hub is a proposed central manager of yoyoengine versions.

## Usage

The hub will provide a gui to see and manage yoyoeditor installs.

Each yoyoeditor install has its own folder in a managed location, and its own list of projects to sandbox and seperate projects across your versions.

## Distribution

The hub will be built by pyinstaller, and distributed as a single executable file.

## Considerations

- add version tracking into the yoyoengine projects themselves
- add concrete version checking functions into editor (build X.X)
